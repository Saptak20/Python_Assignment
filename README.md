This repository contains solutions for 50 Python programming questions from my assignment.
The questions cover important topics like data types, control flow, functions, data structures, file handling, and exception handling.

The solutions are divided into 5 parts:

Section A (Q1–15): Data types, loops, and strings

Section B (Q16–30): Functions and recursion

Section C (Q31–40): Lists, dictionaries, and tuples

Section D (Q41–45): File operations

Section E (Q46–50): Error handling

Each section is in a separate Python file, easy to run with Python 3.
You can also find the original questions in the included PDF file.

Clone the repo and run any file to test the solutions.
